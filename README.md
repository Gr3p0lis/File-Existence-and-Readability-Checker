# File-Existence-and-Readability-Checker
Description:
This Java program demonstrates how to check for the existence of a file and how to handle various exceptions that might occur when attempting to read the file. The program performs the following steps:

Check File Existence: Verifies if a file at a specified path exists and prints the result.
Print Working Directory: Displays the current working directory and its canonical path.
List Root Directories: Lists all root directories of the file system.
Read File Content: Contains methods to read a file while handling potential exceptions such as FileNotFoundException, IOException, NullPointerException, and IllegalArgumentException.
Exception Handling: Demonstrates the use of try-catch blocks to handle multiple types of exceptions, and the use of the finally block to execute code regardless of exceptions.
